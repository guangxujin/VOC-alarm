# VOC-alarm

Our system includes timely genetic information uptake and digest (by analyses of SVG, pace of SGV, stage, and mutational entropy), early detection of VOCs, and informing a quick and timely response. To enable early-detection of VOCs, we designed a forecasting approach for predicting a VOC while its population is still small but be ready for emergence.
